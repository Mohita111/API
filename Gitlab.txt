GitLab vs. GitHub: Key Differences for Technical Writers

While GitLab and GitHub both offer Git-based version control, CI/CD, and collaboration features, GitLab is a complete DevOps platform, whereas GitHub relies on integrations with third-party tools for some functionalities.

Below are the key differences relevant to a technical writer:

1️⃣ Built-in CI/CD: GitLab vs. GitHub Actions
Feature	GitLab	GitHub
CI/CD	Built-in GitLab CI/CD with .gitlab-ci.yml	Requires GitHub Actions (separate setup)
Free Runners	Free shared runners with limited minutes	Free runners with limited minutes
Self-hosted Runners	Available for free	Available for free
📌 Key Difference:

GitLab integrates CI/CD natively (in one tool), whereas GitHub needs GitHub Actions, which requires extra setup and YAML configuration.
If you need automated documentation deployment (e.g., MkDocs, Sphinx), GitLab CI/CD is more seamless.
🔹 Example:
GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/deploy.yml):

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Deploy Docs
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install MkDocs
        run: pip install mkdocs-material
      - name: Build & Deploy
        run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
GitLab CI/CD (.gitlab-ci.yml):

yaml
Copy
Edit
deploy_docs:
  stage: deploy
  image: python:3.9
  script:
    - pip install mkdocs-material
    - mkdocs build
    - mkdocs gh-deploy --force
  only:
    - main
👉 GitLab simplifies CI/CD by keeping everything inside one platform.

2️⃣ Project Management & Issue Tracking
Feature	GitLab	GitHub
Issue Tracking	Built-in Agile-style issue tracking	Issues & Discussions (less structured)
Epics & Roadmaps	✅ Yes (Paid)	❌ No
Built-in Kanban Boards	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Merge Request Approvals	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
📌 Key Difference:

GitLab has more advanced issue tracking, epics, and roadmaps, making it better for large-scale documentation projects.
GitHub offers issues & discussions but lacks epics and roadmaps unless you integrate third-party tools like ZenHub or Jira.
🔹 Example Use Case for Technical Writers:
GitLab:

Track documentation tasks as issues
Organize documentation milestones using Epics & Roadmaps
Automate issue tracking with CI/CD
3️⃣ Self-Hosting & Security
Feature	GitLab	GitHub
Self-hosting	✅ Yes (GitLab Self-Managed)	❌ No (Only GitHub Enterprise Cloud)
Free Private Repos	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Advanced Permissions	✅ Yes (More granular control)	✅ Yes
📌 Key Difference:

GitLab allows self-hosting, making it ideal for internal documentation in large enterprises.
GitHub requires GitHub Enterprise Cloud for similar self-hosted functionality.
🔹 Example Use Case for Technical Writers:
If you're documenting internal APIs for a corporate intranet, GitLab self-hosting ensures confidentiality & security.

4️⃣ Documentation Wikis
Feature	GitLab	GitHub
Built-in Wiki	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
📌 No major difference here. Both support wikis, which can be used for internal documentation.

5️⃣ Code Review & Collaboration
Feature	GitLab	GitHub
Merge Requests (MRs)	✅ Yes (Native)	✅ Yes (Pull Requests)
Inline Comments	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Suggest Changes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Protected Branches	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
📌 No major difference for a technical writer. Both support reviewing and merging documentation updates effectively.

🔍 When to Choose GitLab vs. GitHub?
Use Case	Choose GitLab	Choose GitHub
CI/CD for docs	✅ Built-in GitLab CI/CD	✅ GitHub Actions (extra setup)
Self-hosted Docs	✅ Yes	❌ No
Enterprise Use	✅ Best for private/internal docs	✅ Best for open-source docs
Project Management	✅ Advanced issue tracking	✅ Good but requires integrations
🚀 Final Verdict for Technical Writers
If you want an all-in-one DevOps tool with built-in CI/CD and project management, GitLab is the better choice.
If you're contributing to open-source projects or prefer GitHub Actions, GitHub is better.
